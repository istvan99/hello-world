# hello-world
My first repository
As the heading denotes this is my first repository on GitHub. My name is Istvan Mayer and I am
an aspiring coder, aged 19. I started learing to program when I was 15, begin with a simplified
dialect of Java in 2014. The year after, 2015, I took IT as a subject at school where we started
with Scratch 2.0. After which we did for 2 years Delphi. In those two years I dabbled with Ruby, C
and C++. In my last year, matric year 2017, I started working with Linux, my first distro was Zorin
after which I moved on to Lubuntu. Now in 2018 I have since changed to use Debian for my main OS on 
the laptop, whilst still using w10 on my Desktop PC and Slax when working on other peoples' laptops 
or computers using a live usb. Currently I am studying at CTU IT Training Solutions, Potchefstroom,
the MSCD Certificate. I mainly code in C# as of current, which I enjoy a lot alongside JavaScript 
for the Internet Programming.

I am currently also learning Python and still Ruby, Python for helping my friends that studies BsC IT
as that is what their using and also because it is quite a good language which I enjoy. I still code in
Ruby, after which I want to learn Ruby on Rails Framework. I have toyed with Bash and have a keen interest
into looking at what I can do with Perl.

I live in South Africa.
